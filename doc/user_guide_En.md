## What is Pytheas for Youtube ?

Pytheas is an online interface designed to simplify and enhance the downloading of data related to youtube. 

Pytheas is linked to ** the youtube Data V3 ** API, provided by Google, which gives access to the following data: videos, authors' channels, playlist, comments, subtitles, etc.

## Exploration 

https://pytheas.cortext.net/explore

Simply allow the data view that Google shows us, for:

- One video
- One channel
- One playlist

## Harvest parameter

A ** query ** in pytheas corresponds to a set of delimited videos according to criteria.

### search by query youtube

https://pytheas.cortext.net/get-data

Using the youtube search engine.

Default between 500 and 1000 videos (including a strong relevance for the first 500 only). Match the copy of the youtube search engine.

Need a language.

* Advance time stamped search
Time-stamped search allows you to repeat a query from the youtube search engine by calibrating it on a day. This makes it possible to extend considerably the sets harvested at the expense of declining relevance.

### By channels

Search videos by channel youtube.
